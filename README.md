## Introduction
This is a simple number guessing game built only for learning clojure and play-cljs. 

* Think of a number between the given range.
* The screen flashes a number.
* Use up and down arrow keys to indicate if the guessed number is above or below the flashed number.
* Stop when the flashed number shows.

Do `boot run` to develop and `boot build` to compile a release version.
